Suggest 3 eco tips for energy efficiency in homes

1. **Insulate Properly**: Ensure your home is well-insulated, especially in walls, attics, and floors. This reduces heat loss in winter and keeps your home cooler in summer, thus reducing the need for heating and cooling.

2. **Upgrade to Energy-Efficient Appliances**: When it's time to replace appliances, opt for ENERGY STAR certified models. These appliances use at least 10% less energy than standard models, leading to lower utility bills and a reduced carbon footprint.

3. **Implement Smart Home Technology**: Use smart thermostats, lighting controls, and smart plugs to manage energy use on an individual basis. These devices can learn your habits and automatically adjust settings to save energy when you're not home or asleep. They can also be controlled remotely via smartphones, allowing for real-time adjustments and optimal energy use.
